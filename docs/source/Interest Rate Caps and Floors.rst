Interest Rate Caps and Floors
=============================

Overview
--------
Caps and floors are OTC interest rate products referring to interest rate index like LIBOR or national interest rates (e.g. USD LIBOR, Euribor etc.). Caps are a series of caplets or call options which mature periodically (quarterly, semi-annually or yearly). Similarly floors are a series of put options. Interest rate caps and floors are used for hedging against rising or declining rates. 

Pricing and valuation of each caplets / floorlets are determined using Black formula.

Description about the API
-------------------------
Analytical function to calculate pricing and risk metrics is implemented in C++. 

This function takes volatility surface, yield curves, Cap / Floor type, Notional, Times to maturity, payment frequency, currency as inputs. This generates PV, Delta (DV01), Gamma as outputs. 

This C++ function is wrapped and can be used in **Python** using below code snippet: 

``>>> import MyAnalytics`` 

``>>> res = MyAnalytics.computeCapFloorMetrics(mkt, CapFloorType, Notional, Strike, TimesToMaturity, PaymentFrequency='3M', currency='USD', CalcType='PV')`` 

Below are the *mandatory* parameters for this function:

CapFloorType = 'Cap' or 'Floor', 

Notional = Notional amount of the trade, 

Strike = Strike of Caps / Floors, 

TimesToMaturity = Times to matury in number of years. E.g. 0.25 (3 month tenor), 1 (1 year tenor), 5 (5 year tenor) etc. 


Below are the *optional* parameters for this function:

PaymentFrequency = Payment frequency which can be '3M', '6M'or '1Y'. If this is not provided, '3M' will be used as default. 

currency = If this is not provided, 'USD' will be used as default.

An example **Python** code is shown below: 


``>>> import MyAnalytics`` 

``>>> atm_vol_tenors = [30, 360, 720, 1800, 3600]`` 

``>>> atm_vol_surface = [[16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5], [16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5], [16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5], [16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5],[16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5, 16.5]]`` 

``>>> yield_curves_tenors = [30, 360, 720, 1800, 3600]`` 

``>>> yield_curves = [0.01, 0.012, 0.0125, 0.0127, 0.013]`` 

``>>> mkt = [atm_vol_tenors, atm_vol_surface, yield_curves_tenors, yield_curves]`` 

``>>> res = MyAnalytics.computeCapFloorMetrics(mkt, x, y, z, â€¦)``
