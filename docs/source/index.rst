Interest rate caps and floors: 
Caps and floors are OTC interest rate products referring to interest rate index like LIBOR or national interest rates (e.g. USD LIBOR, Euribor etc.). Caps are a series of caplets or call options which mature periodically (quarterly, semi-annually or yearly). Similarly floors are a series of put options. Interest rate caps and floors are used for heading against rising or declining rates. 

Analytical function to calculate pricing and risk metrics is implemented in C++: computeCapFloorMetrics(Market market, ArgType1 x1, ArgType2 x2, â€¦). The current version is 1.0.0.
