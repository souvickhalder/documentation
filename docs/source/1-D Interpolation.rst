1-D Interpolation
=================

Overview
--------
This function takes abscissae (X) and ordinate (Y) and known x value(s) is(are) provided as inputs. Based on the interpolation type (e.g. linear, quadratic, cubic) mentioned, it outputs the interpolated value(s).

Description about the API
-------------------------
Analytical function for 1-D Interpolation is implemented in C++. 

This function takes abscissae (X) and ordinate (Y) and known x value(s) and interpolation type as inputs. If x is a scalar, the function returns . 

.. note::

   Few *Assumptions* should be considered while using this API: X and Y .
